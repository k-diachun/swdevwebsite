	<p>Charles is the craftsman at Heistand Woodworking and he has been working with wood since he was 6 years old when he received his first real hand tool set.  He enjoyed spending his time building anything he could around the house with the scraps of wood available to him. In high school he took wood shop classes which gave him the introductory skills required to be able to make simple items. After high school he chose to pursue an Electrical Engineering undergraduate degree which gave him the skills required to design custom products in CAD software. Heistand Woodworking became the fulfillment of a lifelong dream when it was established by Charles at the age of 22. He takes pride in his work and being able to sell customers quality products that are 100% hand-made gives him the satisfaction of knowing that they get the exact product they want and the quality no pre-made furniture can offer. Every project that is completed needs to meet a different set of requirements which is what makes woodworking his passion. Charles truly loves the satisfaction of being able to start with a pile of boards and finish with a heirloom quality product.</p>
